This repository was created to manage version control for a group project in Database Management Systems course. 
Group members included Cole Gibeau, Kendrick Huynh, Srijan Awale, and Ethan Klien

The objective of this group project was to create a database for a car rental company from scratch.

 This project included...
   --Brainstorming and deciding on all business rules, entities and relationships.
   --Creating an ERD and going through 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal forms as well as BCNF. 
   --Taking these these ideas from our ERD into real tables in SQL Server Management Studio 21 using DDL code
   --Creating dummy data for all tables using DML

Once we tested we had a working relational database by performing basic joins without error we then created the following different tools using TSQL..
  --Trigger
  --Stored Procedure
  --Cursor
  --Subquery
  --CTE
  --UDF
  --Pivot


We then created copies of our intial DDL and DML files to alter them to migrate the database into MYSQL since MYSQL follows different conventions then SSMS's TSQL

Once we had confirmed our new MYSQL DDL and DML files worked successfully we started the website portion of our project using PHP.
